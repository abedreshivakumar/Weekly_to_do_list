# Weekly_to_do_list
In this I have created the weekly to do list where I can add tasks edit and it update it progress for the entire week.
This Flask application manages a todo list organized by days of the week. It initializes with predefined weekdays and an empty task list for each day. The load_tasks() function loads tasks from a JSON file (tasks.json) into memory, while save_tasks() saves the current state back to the file. The main routes include / for displaying the todo list using index.html, /add for adding tasks via a form submission, and /update for marking tasks as completed or updating their status. Each route handles POST requests to modify the todo_list in memory and persist changes to tasks.json. Overall, the application leverages Flask to create a simple yet effective task management system with basic file-based persistence.
